### Fantasy Premiere League Analysis
  Fantasy Football is a game in which participants assemble an imaginary team of real life footballers and points based on those players' actual  performance. By the end of the season the winner is the participant who gain the highest points. 
	I started by modified scraping scripts using for gathering data from an official Premiere League APIs and then I develop my own strategy based on that data. My strategy was split into 2 parts

My analysis was splitted into 2 parts

  1. Form the right squad: Analyse each player stats and use insights gained from that analysis to form a group of players that tend to produce the highest score throughout the season under a constrained budget.

  
  2.Choose the right captain: Use players historical stats to build models which predict how likely a player will score in the upcoming week. In FPL, you can pick one of your team to be the captain and choosing the right captain is very important because points gained by your captain will be doubled.
